# Randomized projection for constrained regression

Tensorflow implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0347v1.pdf

## Things to code
* Leverage sampling
* Hadamard projection
* Backstepping?
* Logistic regression

## Figures to create
* Mean squared error ratio vs projection dimension
* Hessian sketching vs gradient descent paths
